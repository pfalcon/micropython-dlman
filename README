dlman, a simple download manager frontend for wget
==================================================

This is simple, but complete and deployable Pycopy
(https://github.com/pfalcon/pycopy) application for embedded Linux
systems.

The application, running as a daemon, watches a configured directory
for new files, each containing a URL of file to download. Once found,
URL is downloaded using wget with user-defined options. The idea is
that you will run dlman or NAS-like system, with input directory for
URLs and output directory for download files mounted over network
for easy access with your other computing devices and media players.

Basic error handling is implemented, for example after transient network
error, download will continue after pause, and yet permanent errors
should be detected and not lead to infinite download loops. All the
functionality above is very basic, and leaves much room for elaboration
and improvement.

dlman can be deployed to any embeded Linux system accessible via SSH and
which has Pycopy already installed.

To deploy the app, edit variables at the top of the Makefile and
application config (sample is provided as config.py.nas). And run
"make deploy". As first step of the process, dependency modules
(as specified in requirements.txt) will be downloaded from Python
packages repository, PyPI (https://pypi.python.org/).

To run dlman, start dlman.sh (it will log to dlman.log). To make it keep
running after you log out from target system, it should be run as
"nohup ./dlman.sh". Alternatively, dlman.sh can be run using startup
scripts during system boot (exact details depend on particular Linux
system used).

WARNING: Currently, dlman is not suitable for production use (for
example, it uses directory polling to find new files to download, and
it was found this may preclude disk drives to go into suspend state
on a real NAS system). So, currently it is mostly example of how to
deploy a Pycopy application. The functionality of dlman will be
elaborated as time permits.
